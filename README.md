# roguelikeGameDevelopment-Tutorial
Found out about this awesome project on reddit, a tutorial that helps you create a roguelike style game by following simple steps every week.

I'm currently following it step by step, but once finished I'll look to add things on my own, and maybe try and implement it in other languages.

If you're curious and want to follow it too, you can here : http://rogueliketutorials.com/
